It uses driving data from several thousand individual vehicles. ","2":"Agent-based technology adoption and social innovation diffusion model in the residential sector.","3":"CHANCE is a macro-micro model based on a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that includes a large amount of household microdata. It is a disaggregated multiregional and multisector model that included information for around 200,000 households covering all EU regions, ensuring a large representation of the behaviour of the European households. Therefore, CHANCE is a model designed to analyse the socioeconomic and distributional impacts of public policies that directly affect households and consumers, both economic, energy, environmental or fiscal.","4":"Partial equilibrium model focusing on EU28 and neighbouring countries' interconnected gas markets.","5":"EnergyPLAN is an input-output model that simulates the annual operation of the entire energy system in hourly time steps. It includes electricity, heating, cooling, transport, industry and desalination demands. For production it includes various types of power plants, variable renewable energy sources and combined heat and power plants. The main focus is to be able to simulate smart energy systems, and therefore includes modelling of electricity, district heating and gas grids. It allows for many types of P2X applications both for heating, gas and liquid fuels.","6":"The China-MORE model is a bottom-up China Multi-gas Optimal Reduction Evaluation model based on TIMES veda 2.0 software. ","7":"CLEWs is a modelling framework that has been used for the case study of Ethiopia. Using OSeMOSYS, a representation of the energy, land and water systems and the links between them is created. Climate change is an input to the model and is included as variation of temperature (therefore, evaporation and evapotranspiration) and of precipitation patterns. The energy system includes representation of geothermal, diesel, biofuels and waste, wind, hydropower and PV power plants. The land system includes land cover, water uses and energy uses by built-up environment, water bodies, forest land, grassland and 7 main crops( maize, teff, sorghum, wheat, barley, sugar cane and coffee). Each crop area is further divided into irrigated and rainfed crop, with different levels of productivity dependent on the agro-climatic conditions.

These case studies use the Open Source Modelling Tool (OSeMOSYS), a technologically-detailed techno-economic optimisation tool, which enabled to create a techno-economic representation of the climate, land, energy and water systems, where the parts of these systems are represented as a number of processes with certain transfer functions and exchanging between them different commodities. For example, one particular agricultural land use is represented as a \u2018box\u2019 that takes a certain quantity of water, energy and land area as inputs and delivers part of the water (through ground water recharge or surface run off) and a crop with a certain yields. In this way, the total land use of the region can be represented through many such \u2018boxes\u2019 in parallel, with different inputs and different yields, and a competition between these uses can be created, on the basis of their costs and the resource availability. The optimisation seeks to minimise the Net Present Value of all costs incurred across the water, energy and land sectors in the whole time domain analysed (typically, of several decades), while meeting an increasing demand for commodities (e.g. food products) and resource availability constraints. \\nThe time domain goes from 2020 up to 2050. For a good time resolution have been considered 4 seasons 2 day-types (day\/night), getting a total of 8 time-slices in order to capture the renewable supply variability but without making the computation incredibly heavy. The energy sector rapresents the fuels imported (coal, gasoline and diesel) or locally extracted (for the geothermal and biofuel and waste supply) that are needed as an input for the power plants and domestic demand (e.g for transport, industrial and residential use). Then, for the electricity production, the conversion technologies are represented separatelly and convert the input (fuel used) into electricity which is then taken by the transmission system in order to meet the final electric demand.  The scale is national and represents Ethiopia as a whole. Also the emissions are represented as CO2 equivalent (hence considering, a part from CO2, also CH4 and NO2) for each fossil fuel, input as Mton\/PJ being linearly dependent on generation. The land system model represents the total land which is then divided into built-up land, forest, grassland, barren land, water bodies, other (e.g. natural reserves), pastures and crops. Each crop is again divided in 5 categories of land uses, depending on the type of inputs: irrigated land with intermediate or high input (in terms of fertilizers, chemicals, mechanization and energy) and rainfed land with low, intermediate and high input. Each of these types will have different yields and they compete between themselves in the model, based on cost- and resource-optimality criteria. Finally, land uses are also divided in clusters, which aggregate cells of the region with similar agro-climatic conditions. All this categorization and all input data is derived from the FAOSTAT database. Emissions from land use changes are represented, following the standards defined by IPCC for emissions accounting and comparing the environmental impact under four different scenarios: business as usual (BAU), Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and two with climate change impacts (BAU-CC and NDC-CC). The water system represents precipitation, all water inputs and outputs of land uses, and all final water demands \/ uses. Precipitation, evaporation from water bodies and evapotranspiration from vegetation are represented and vary according to climatic conditions and climate change. Groundwater and surface water uses are represented separately. For the climate change scenarios, has been considered a variation in the precipitation that would affect the hydropower capacity factor and crops yields. Finally,  the energy, water and land systems are interlinked, for instance water used by power plants, diesel used by agricultural activities and water used by irrigation.","8":"The Climate, Land, Energy, Water systems (CLEWs) framework is an integrated resource modelling framework that is being used to assess the different interlinkages between sectors and how policies made in these individual sectors would impact the others.

By using the OseMOSYS tool we are able to model the investment needs for policies in not just the energy sector but as well as land and water sectors. And in turn we can see the impact of these policies on sustainability and development. The Kenya CLEWS model developed using OseMOSYS covers a time domain from 2020 to 2050.

In the energy sector 6 powerplants are covered for electricity production including; geothermal, hydro, solar pv, wind, biomass and light fuel imports. Diesel imports are also covered for agricultural mechanization as well as transport uses. The land sector is divided into 6 subsectors including; cropland, forests, built-up land, waterbodies, and other land uses. Croplnad is further represented by 5 main crops; maize, beans, tea, sorghum and cowpeas which are represented for rainfed and irrigated areas for high and low seasons. Built-up land accounts for both urbanization as well as land used for energy powerplants. Water bodies represents both groundwater recharge as well as surfcae water, and other land uses accounts for grassland, shrubland, wetlands and barren lands.

Agricultural land is further divided into major crops in Sri Lanka; rice-paddy, tea, coconut, maize, and rubber, which must all meet exogenously defined demands. Crop imports are also considered.

CLEWs models can be developed with different approaches and different modelling tools. One of them, largely employed by UNDP and UNDESA in capacity development activities worldwide, uses the Open Source Modelling Tool (OSeMOSYS), a technologically-detailed techno-economic optimisation tool. By using this tool, we create a techno-economic representation of the climate, land, energy and water systems, where the parts of these systems are represented as a number of processes with certain transfer functions and exchanging between them different commodities. For example, one particular agricultural land use is represented as a \u2018box\u2019 that takes a certain quantity of water, energy and land area as inputs and delivers part of the water (through ground water recharge or surface run off) and a crop with a certain yields. In this way, the total land use of the region can be represented through many such \u2018boxes\u2019 in parallel, with different inputs and different yields, and a competition between these uses can be created, on the basis of their costs and the resource availability. The optimisation seeks to minimise the Net Present Value of all costs incurred across the water, energy and land sectors in the whole time domain analysed (typically, of several decades), while meeting an increasing demand for commodities (e.g. food products) and resource availability constraints. \\nThe time domain of an application may cover e.g. up to 2070 or more. A good time resolution that allows rather detailed representation of renewables without making the computation incredibly heavy could be around 100 time slices. The energy sector is the one requiring the highest time resolution, so such time resolution would be good also for the other sectors. The energy system typically could include any energy conversion and energy storage process like other TIMES applications. It can be regionalized and some power infrastructure can be represented individually, if important. Any type of emission can be represented, as long as emission factors are available and as long as emissions are linearly dependent on generation. The land system model represents many possible types of land uses, including built-up land, forest, grassland, barren land, water bodies, other (e.g. natural reserves), pastures and crops. Crops are further divided in any type of crop that is relevant in the region being analysed. Each crop is again divided in 5 categories of land uses, depending on the type of inputs: irrigated land with intermediate or high input (in terms of fertilizers, chemicals, mechanization and energy) and rainfed land with low, intermediate and high input. Each of these types will have different yields and they compete between themselves in the model, based on cost- and resource-optimality criteria. Finally, land uses are also divided in clusters, which aggregate cells of the region with similar agro-climatic conditions. All this categorization and all input data are usually derived from GAEZ, but data can (and should) be extracted from local\/national sources, if they are available. Emissions from land use changes can also be represented, e.g. following the standards defined by IPCC for emissions accounting. The water system represents precipitation, all water inputs and outputs of land uses, and all final water demands \/ uses. Precipitation, evaporation from water bodies and evapotranspiration from vegetation are represented. They vary according to climatic conditions and climate change. Groundwater and surface water uses are represented separately (but need improvement). The water system is part of the optimisation. However, it can also be represented with an accounting model externally to OSeMOSYS (e.g. using WEAP) and soft-linked with OSeMOSYS. Several such applications have been developed. Many links between the energy, water and land systems are usually represented, e.g. water uses by power plants, diesel uses by agricultural activities, water uses by irrigation, and more. The links can be customised (and more can be added), depending on the scope of the analysis and the research or policy questions.","13":null,"14":null,"15":"DREEM is a fully integrated dynamic high-resolution demand simulation model resolving key features that are not found together in existing demand-side management models.

The unique feature of EXPANSE is that it applies Modelling to Generate Alternatives method (MGA) to compute and analyze large numbers of cost-optimal and near-optimal scenarios with only a single set of assumptions. The principle of MGA is to relax the cost-optimality assumption and instead define an acceptable range of total system costs to search for scenarios within this acceptable range.

It is primarily designed to provide users with a tool to evaluate the effects of policy changes on the economy and the environment. The model has a global coverage (46 countries regions) where the G-20 countries, and the countries that are major equipment manufacturers or energy exporters are represented individually.  All countries are linked through trade transactions. The GEM-E3 model is based on a number of different components that represent various aspects of the economy. These components include the household sector, the business sector, the government sector, and the international\/external sector. Each of these components is further divided into sub-components that capture the complexities of the different sectors of the economy. The household sector includes all households in the economy and their consumption and savings behavior. The business sector includes all firms in the economy characterized by their production capacities and investment behavior. The government sector includes all levels of government and their spending and revenue-raising behavior. The international sector includes all international trade flows and capital flows. The GEM-E3 model uses mathematical equations to represent the behavior of these different components and how do they interact with each other. The model\u2019s mathematical formulation is based on economic theory and established empirical relationships. The model is calibrated to represent the specific characteristics of the economy being analyzed. The model is calibrated in a base year that it is fully reproduced - the solution of the model matches the observed data in the base year. The empirical relationships (e.g. labor supply curve) are updated with the most recent empirical findings One of the key strengths of the GEM-E3 model is its ability to simulate and quantify the effects of alternative policies. For instance, it can be used to simulate the impact of changes in taxation, carbon pricing, trade policies, environmental regulations, or infrastructure investments on the economy and the environment.  The global coverage of GEM-E3 model allows to analyze the impacts of policies across different regions or countries. It can be used to analyze the impacts of policies in specific regions or countries, as well as the effects of global policies on the world economy and the environment. This makes it a valuable tool for users who want to evaluate the likely outcomes of different policy choices before their actual implementation. The GEM-E3 model is capable  to analyze the interactions between the economy and the environment. It includes a module that captures the environmental impacts of economic activities, such as greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, or land use changes.

A single optimisation, which searches for the maximal net total surplus, simulates market equilibrium for each commodity (energy, material, demand). Maximising the net total surplus (i.e. the sum of producers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 surpluses) is operationally done by minimising the net total cost of the energy system. The second component (variables) corresponds mainly to future investments and activities of technologies at each time period, amount of energy produced or consumed by technologies, as well as energy imports and exports. An additional output of the model is the implicit price (shadow price) of each energy form, material and emission, as well as the reduced cost of each technology (reduction required to make a technology competitive). The third component (constraints) corresponds to various limits (e.g. amount of energy resources available) and obligations (e.g. energy balances throughout the system, useful energy demand satisfaction) to be respected.\\nThe main model assumptions leading to optimal outputs include future technological developments and the structure of energy markets. On the one hand, technological progress is exogenously assumed, and economic agents have a perfect foresight of this. On the other hand, energy markets are assumed to be under perfect competition.

The representative agents in the modules use information on prices and make decisions about the allocation of resources. They represent, for example, regional electricity sectors, regional refining sectors, regional energy demand sectors, and land users who have to allocate land among competing crops within any given land region. Markets are the means by which these representative agents interact with one another. Agents indicate their intended supply and\/or demand for goods and services in the markets. GCAM solves for a set of market prices so that supplies and demands are balanced in all these markets across the model (see the figure below); in other words, market equilibrium is assumed to take place in each one of these markets (partial equilibrium), and not in the entire economy across all markets (general equilibrium). The GCAM solution process is the process of iterating on market prices until this equilibrium is reached. Markets exist for physical flows such as electricity or agricultural commodities, but they also can exist for other types of goods and services, for example tradable carbon permits.\\n\\nAs an example, in any single model period, GCAM derives a demand for natural gas starting with all of the uses to which natural gas might be put, such as passenger and freight transport, power generation, hydrogen production, heating, cooling and cooking, fertiliser production, and other industrial energy uses. Those demands depend on the external assumptions about, for example, electricity generating technology efficiencies, but also on the price of all of the commodities in the model. GCAM then calculates the amount of natural gas that suppliers would like to supply given their available technology for extracting resources and the market price. The model gathers this same information for all of the commodities and then adjusts prices so that in every market during that period supplies of everything from rice to solar power match demands.\\n\\n*Insert Figure 5*\\n\\nGCAM is a dynamic recursive model, meaning that decision-makers do not know the future when making a decision today, as opposed to other optimisation models, which assume that agents know the future with certainty when they make decisions. After it solves each period, the model then uses the resulting state of the world, including the consequences of decisions made in that period\u2014such as resource depletion, capital stock retirements and installations, and changes to the landscape\u2014and then moves to the next time step and performs the same exercise. The GCAM version used is typically operated in five-year time steps with 2100 as the final calibration year. However, the model has flexibility to be operated at a different time horizon through user-defined parameters.\\n\\nWhile the agents in the GCAM model are assumed to act towards maximising their own self-interest, the model as a whole is not performing an optimisation calculation. In fact, actors in GCAM can make decisions that \u201cseemed like a good idea at the time\u201d, but which are not optimal from a larger social perspective and which the decision maker would not have made had the decision maker known what lay ahead in the future. For example, the model\u2019s actors do not know about future climate regulations, and could install fossil fuel power in the years preceding the implementation of such policies. Also, stated preferences by agents for certain technologies (e.g. transport modes) are calculated in the base year and such preferences are persistent into the future (their evolution can be changed by the user), preventing the solution to be completely cost-minimising or profit-maximising.","24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":"The model adopts a Johansen closure, similar to the neoclassical closure, assuming full employment of labor and full utilization of capital factors in China in the future, and the prices of labor and capital factors are endogenously determined by the model.","30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":"MENA-EDS is a recursive dynamic energy system simulation model.

There are a number of types of policies that can be easily modelled in DYNERIO:\\n\\nTechnological change \\nThrough this model it is possible to implement a perturbation in the starting economic system configuration in order to simulate a change in the way goods and services are produced and\/or consumed. From the environmental perspective, it is possible to couple a technological change with a change in consumption of environmental resources and production of emissions.\\n\\nBehavioural policies\\nIn principle it is possible to assess the impact of changes in behaviour, translated as a change in consumption preferences of the final demand category of households (e.g. impact of teleworking). ","17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":"National renewable electricity targets, emission constraints, feed-in tariffs and subsidies, carbon prices.","22":null,"23":"One of GCAM\u2019s uses is to explore the implications of different future policies. There are a number of types of policies that can be easily modelled in GCAM:\\n\\nEmissions-related policies \\nThere are three main policy approaches that can be applied in GCAM to reduce emissions of CO2 or other GHGs: carbon\/GHG prices, emissions constraints, or climate constraints. In all cases, GCAM implements the policy approach by placing a price on emissions. This price then filters down through all systems in GCAM and alters production and demand. For example, a price on carbon would put a cost on emitting fossil fuels. This cost would then influence the cost of producing electricity from fossil-fired power plants that emit CO2, which would then influence their relative cost compared to other electricity generating technologies and increase the price of electricity. The increased price of electricity would then make its way to consumers that use electricity, decreasing its competitiveness relative to other fuels and leading to a decrease in electricity demand.\\n\\nCarbon or GHG prices: GCAM users can directly specify the price of carbon or GHG emissions. Given a carbon price, the resulting emissions will vary depending on other scenario drivers, such as population, GDP, resources, and technology. \\nEmissions constraints: GCAM users can specify the total amount of (CO2 or other GHG) emissions as well. GCAM will then calculate the price of carbon needed to reach the constraint in each period of the constraint. \\nClimate constraints: GCAM users can specify a climate variable (e.g. concentration or radiative forcing) target for a particular year. Users determine whether that target can be exceeded prior to the target year. GCAM will adjust carbon prices in order to find the least-cost path to reaching the target.\\n\\nEmissions prices of different GHGs can be linked together for a multi-gas policy. Additionally, markets in GCAM can be set for any emission species (e.g., CH4-only market, NOx market, etc.). In addition to identifying emission prices as one measure of cost, GCAM employs the \u201cdeadweight loss\u201d approach to measuring welfare loss from emissions mitigation efforts through carbon pricing.\\n\\nEnergy production policies \\nThere are times when users would like to explore the implications of a constraint on production or a minimum production requirement. This capability allows GCAM users to model policies such as renewable portfolio standards and biofuels standards. Across sectors, these constraints must be applied as quantity constraints, but they can be applied as share constraints within individual sectors (e.g. fraction of electricity that comes from solar power). In implementing these policies, users can set either a lower bound or an upper bound. The model will solve for the tax (upper bound) or subsidy (lower bound) required to reach the given constraint.\\n\\nLand use policies\\nProtected Lands: With this policy, GCAM users can set aside a fraction of natural land, removing it from economic competition. This land cannot be converted to crops, pasture, or any other land type. This is similar to real-world policies such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). \\nValuing carbon in land: When applying a price on carbon through any of the emissions-related policy approaches, GCAM users can choose whether that price extends to land use change CO2 emissions. This policy is modelled as a subsidy to land-owners for holding carbon stocks as opposed to a price on the emissions themselves. \\nBioenergy constraints: GCAM users can impose constraints on bioenergy within GCAM. Under such a policy, GCAM will calculate the tax or subsidy required to ensure that the constraint is met.

These include demographic and economic activity indicators, primary and final energy consumption by main fuel, fuel resources and prices, CO2 emissions, greenhouse gases concentrations and technology dynamics (for power generation, road transport, hydrogen production and industrial and residential end-use technologies).\\n\\nMENA-EDS quantifies CO2 emissions and incorporates environmentally oriented emission abatement technologies (including renewable energy, electric vehicles, Carbon Capture and Storage, energy efficiency, electrification, green hydrogen, advanced biofuels) and energy and climate policy instruments. The latter include both market based instruments such as cap and trade systems with differential application per region and sector specific policies and measures focusing on specific carbon emitting activities. Key characteristics of the model, that are particularly pertinent for performing the analysis of the implications of alternative climate abatement scenarios, include world supply\/demand resolution for determining the prices of internationally traded fuels and technology dynamics mechanisms for simulating spill-over effects for technological improvements (increased uptake of a new technology in one part of the world leads to improvements through learning by experience which eventually benefits the energy systems in other parts of the World). MENA-EDS is designed to provide medium and long term energy system projections and system restructuring up to 2050 (and 2100), both in the energy demand and the supply sides. The model produces analytical quantitative results in the form of detailed energy balances in the period 2015 to 2050 annually (to be expanded to 2100). The model can support impact assessment of specific energy and environment policies and measures, applied at regional and global level, including price signals, such as taxation, subsidies, technology and energy efficiency promoting policies, RES supporting policies, environmental policies and technology standards.  \\n","37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":"Geographic coverage:\\nCurrently models at national and sub-national scales.\\n\\nSpatial resolution\\nOnSSET uses population clusters derived from 100m resolution population dataset.

Applications with hourly time resolution exist.\\n\\nTechnological Characterization:\\nThe user can create any number and type of technology, with any custom characteristic. In the power sector, a single power plant as well as aggregations of power plants can be represented. Representations of the energy sector with up to 60-70 technologies per country are common.
