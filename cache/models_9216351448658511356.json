Firstly, the energy service demand module provides the service demand of industry, construction, transportation, agriculture, waste treatment and other sectors according to the social and economic development factors. The model energy system optimization module can obtain the fuel combination and technology composition with minimum cost according to the given demand level. At the same time, pollutant emission module and GHG (CO2 excluded) emission module output emission data of different scenarios.

These case studies use the Open Source Modelling Tool (OSeMOSYS), a technologically-detailed techno-economic optimisation tool, which enabled to create a techno-economic representation of the climate, land, energy and water systems, where the parts of these systems are represented as a number of processes with certain transfer functions and exchanging between them different commodities. For example, one particular agricultural land use is represented as a \u2018box\u2019 that takes a certain quantity of water, energy and land area as inputs and delivers part of the water (through ground water recharge or surface run off) and a crop with a certain yields. In this way, the total land use of the region can be represented through many such \u2018boxes\u2019 in parallel, with different inputs and different yields, and a competition between these uses can be created, on the basis of their costs and the resource availability. The optimisation seeks to minimise the Net Present Value of all costs incurred across the water, energy and land sectors in the whole time domain analysed (typically, of several decades), while meeting an increasing demand for commodities (e.g. food products) and resource availability constraints. \\nThe time domain goes from 2020 up to 2050. For a good time resolution have been considered 4 seasons 2 day-types (day\/night), getting a total of 8 time-slices in order to capture the renewable supply variability but without making the computation incredibly heavy. The energy sector rapresents the fuels imported (coal, gasoline and diesel) or locally extracted (for the geothermal and biofuel and waste supply) that are needed as an input for the power plants and domestic demand (e.g for transport, industrial and residential use). Then, for the electricity production, the conversion technologies are represented separatelly and convert the input (fuel used) into electricity which is then taken by the transmission system in order to meet the final electric demand.  The scale is national and represents Ethiopia as a whole. Also the emissions are represented as CO2 equivalent (hence considering, a part from CO2, also CH4 and NO2) for each fossil fuel, input as Mton\/PJ being linearly dependent on generation. The land system model represents the total land which is then divided into built-up land, forest, grassland, barren land, water bodies, other (e.g. natural reserves), pastures and crops. Each crop is again divided in 5 categories of land uses, depending on the type of inputs: irrigated land with intermediate or high input (in terms of fertilizers, chemicals, mechanization and energy) and rainfed land with low, intermediate and high input. Each of these types will have different yields and they compete between themselves in the model, based on cost- and resource-optimality criteria. Finally, land uses are also divided in clusters, which aggregate cells of the region with similar agro-climatic conditions. All this categorization and all input data is derived from the FAOSTAT database. Emissions from land use changes are represented, following the standards defined by IPCC for emissions accounting and comparing the environmental impact under four different scenarios: business as usual (BAU), Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and two with climate change impacts (BAU-CC and NDC-CC). The water system represents precipitation, all water inputs and outputs of land uses, and all final water demands \/ uses. Precipitation, evaporation from water bodies and evapotranspiration from vegetation are represented and vary according to climatic conditions and climate change. Groundwater and surface water uses are represented separately. For the climate change scenarios, has been considered a variation in the precipitation that would affect the hydropower capacity factor and crops yields.

By using the OseMOSYS tool we are able to model the investment needs for policies in not just the energy sector but as well as land and water sectors. And in turn we can see the impact of these policies on sustainability and development. The Kenya CLEWS model developed using OseMOSYS covers a time domain from 2020 to 2050. It also models the two day types- day and night. There are 4 seasons represented, 2 dry seasons and 2 wet seasons which makes for a total of 8 timeslices. In the energy sector 6 powerplants are covered for electricity production including; geothermal, hydro, solar pv, wind, biomass and light fuel imports. Diesel imports are also covered for agricultural mechanization as well as transport uses. The land sector is divided into 6 subsectors including; cropland, forests, built-up land, waterbodies, and other land uses. Croplnad is further represented by 5 main crops; maize, beans, tea, sorghum and cowpeas which are represented for rainfed and irrigated areas for high and low seasons. Built-up land accounts for both urbanization as well as land used for energy powerplants. Water bodies represents both groundwater recharge as well as surfcae water, and other land uses accounts for grassland, shrubland, wetlands and barren lands. The emissions are represented as CO2 equivalents. The model then represents all these interlinkages on the basis of their costs and resource availability.

A single optimisation, which searches for the maximal net total surplus, simulates market equilibrium for each commodity (energy, material, demand). Maximising the net total surplus (i.e. the sum of producers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 surpluses) is operationally done by minimising the net total cost of the energy system.

By allowing the user to select preliminary values for the agent-related parameters according to the plausibility of its results, based on historical data and observations (goodness-of-fit statistics), the model captures input uncertainty (i.e., calibration module). By deriving forward-looking simulations for different behavioural profiles (i.e., different set of agent-related parameters), from willing to invest to risk-averse consumers, ATOM captures parametric uncertainty (i.e., scenario analysis module). Both types of uncertainty are then propagated through the model, and their contribution to the total model\u2019s output\\nvariance is quantified. The rest uncertainty is assumed to be explained by the model\u2019s structure. Note that the uncertainty propagation for the agent-related parameters is done for each one of them, allowing calculation of the sensitivity of each parameter to the model output, in the context of a variance-based sensitivity analysis (Sobol method), and calculation of the relative contribution of the variance for each parameter to the total model output variance (i.e., sensitivity analysis module).\\n\\n<<Please insert FIGURE 1_ATOM.jpg>>","2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":"(1) Taking 2015 and 2020 as the double base years, the current technological status of the energy extraction, energy processing and conversion, industrial, transportation, residential and other end-use energy consumption processes in the whole energy system of China is carefully portrayed.\\n(2) Through extensive literature research, the economic and technical parameters of CO2 and GHG emission reduction technologies in energy extraction, processing and conversion sectors and end-use sectors such as agriculture, industry, construction and transportation are carefully portrayed in the model, and a carbon neutral emission reduction technology database is established to build a data base for research and analysis of carbon neutral pathways in China.\\n(3) Construct a power supply and demand module to simulate the future energy storage and peaking demand of large-scale deployment of renewable energy by portraying the power output curve and power demand curve of wind and other renewable energy sources.\\n(4) Based on the data base of CHINA-MORE model, we build a module for non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions such as methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases, and update the simulation of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emission mechanisms based on the latest literature to expand the CO2 greenhouse gas emission reduction technology library and establish a multi-greenhouse gas emission reduction\\nOptimization module.\\n(5) Establish an uncertainty analysis module to facilitate the analysis of the impact of key parameters of key technologies on the achievement of climate policy goals.\\n","6":"Fully open source, from solver to code, to pre- and post-processing codes, to interfaces, to data.
