Short overview
OSeMOSYS (Open Source Energy Modelling System) is a tool designed to optimize the installed capacities and energy volumes in response to changing electricity consumption. The primary goal of applying the OSeMOSYS model is to minimize the total cost of Ukraine's energy system from 2019 to 2050 while ensuring that electricity demand is met across various sectors, including Agriculture, Commercial and Public, Industry, Residential, and Transport.

This comprehensive analysis incorporates diverse energy resources such as biofuels, coal, diesel oil, electricity, and natural gas. The model simulates scenarios involving various energy technologies, taking into account factors like operational lifetimes, fuel consumption, production and maintenance costs, and technological efficiency. By using data from the Ukrainian energy sector before 2022, the model identifies the optimal energy system configuration prior to the invasion and the subsequent destruction of energy infrastructure.

A key task of this simulation is to determine the most efficient and cost-effective electricity production methods across different generating plants. The model considers a wide range of parameters to pinpoint which types of plants will generate the largest share of electricity. Additionally, the model strategically incorporates the phased decommissioning of thermal power plants (TPPs) that use solid fuels, due to their significant emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. This approach aligns with Ukraine's ongoing challenges in decarbonization and infrastructure reconstruction amidst military operations.

The main objectives of the project include:
- Minimizing the total cost of the Ukrainian energy system from 2019 to 2050;
- Assessing the environmental impact of Ukraine's energy system;
- Identifying optimal production volumes by different types of generating plants.
The model uses a detailed time interval distribution, breaking down the year into 12 months and each day into 8 specific periods that capture different times of the day, such as Early Morning (4-7), Late Morning (8-10), and so on.

The mathematical formulation of the model is based on linear programming optimization, focusing on minimizing the total cost of the power system over time while meeting energy demand and adhering to various constraints.
